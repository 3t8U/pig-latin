## Description

##Specs

  * _Example Output: 3_

* _The program adds "ay" to single-letter words beginning with a vowel._
  * _Example Input: i_
  * _Example Output: iay_

* _For multiple-letter words beginning with a vowel, add "way" to the end.
  * _Example Input: Our_
  * _Example Output: Ourway_

* _For words beginning with one or more consonants, move all of the first consecutive consonants to the end and add "ay"_
  * _Example Input: Christmas_
  * _Example Output: istmas-chray_

* _If the first consonants include "qu", move the "u" along with the "q". Don't forget about words like "squeal" where "qu" doesn't come first!_
  * _Example Input: Squeal_
  * _Example Output: eal-squay_

* _For words beginning with "y", treat "y" as a consonant._
